ounty Dublin ( or ' ' Contae tha Cliath ' ' ) is a county in Ireland . It is sometimes officially referred to as the Dublin Region and is in the province of Leinster . It is named after the city of Dublin , which is the regional capital and the capital city of Ireland . County Dublin was one of the first parts of Ireland to be shired by King John of England following the Norman invasion of Ireland . Prior to 1994 County Dublin was an administrative county run by a county council with functional area covering the whole county excluding the functional area of Dublin City Council . In 1994 Dublin County Council was abolished and replaced with three separate administrative county councils : Dn LaoghaireRathdown , Fingal and South Dublin . The population of the county was 1,270,603 according to the census of 2011. # Local government and politics # There are four local authorities whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Dublin . These are Dublin City Council , South Dublin County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is also Dublin Regional Authority which has authority over the while county but this body has few powers . It consists of 30 representatives who meet once per month . These representatives are nominated from the four administrative councils of the region . Like each Regional Authority , it is assisted in its duties by an Operational Committee and EU Operational Committee . Prior to the enactment of the Local Government ( Dublin ) Act 1993 , the county was a unified whole even though it was administered by two local authorities - Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation . Since the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001 in particular , the geographic area of the county has been divided between three entities at the level of county and a further entity at the level of city . They rank equally as first level local administrative units of the NUTS 3 Dublin Region for Eurostat purposes . There are 34 LAU 1 entities in the Republic of Ireland . Each local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation , planning and development , libraries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing . The county is part of the Dublin constituency for the purposes of European elections . For elections to Dil ireann , the area of the county is today divided into twelve constituencies : Dublin Central , Dublin MidWest , Dublin North , Dublin NorthCentral , Dublin NorthEast , Dublin NorthWest , Dublin South , Dublin SouthCentral , Dublin SouthEast , Dublin SouthWest , Dublin West and Dn Laoghaire . Together they return 47 deputies ( TDs ) to the Dil. # Dublin Region # The Dublin Region is a NUTS Level III region of Ireland . The region is one of eight regions of the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of Eurostat statistics . Its NUTS code is IE021 . It is co-extensive with the old county . The regional capital is Dublin City which is also the national capital . It is governed by the Dublin Regional Authority which consists of 30 representatives who meet once per month .

To these areas may be added the area of Dublin city which collectively comprise the Dublin Region ( ' ' ' ' ) and come under the remit of the Dublin Regional Authority . The area lost its administrative county status in 1994 , with Section 9 Part 1(a) of the ' ' Local Government ( Dublin ) Act , 1993 ' ' stating that the county shall cease to exist . At that time , and in response to a European Council report highlighting Ireland as the most centralised country in the European Union , it was decided that a single County Dublin was unmanageable and undemocratic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve Dublin County Council , Avril Doyle TD said , The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin , and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin .

Despite the legal status of the Dublin Region , the term County Dublin is still in common usage . Many organisations and sporting teams continue to organise on a County Dublin or Dublin Region basis . The area formerly known as County Dublin is now defined in legislation solely as the Dublin Region under the ' ' Local Government Act , 1991 ( Regional Authorities ) ( Establishment ) Order , 1993 ' ' , and this is the terminology officially used by the four Dublin administrative councils in press releases concerning the former county area .

This resulted in the economy of the county expanding by almost 100% between the early 1990s and 2007 . This growth resulted from incoming high-value industries , such as financial services and software manufacturing , as well as low-skilled retail and domestic services , which caused a shift away from older manufacturing-industry . This change saw high unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s which resulted in damage to the capitals social structure .

@@9514 Edvard Hagerup Grieg ( ; 15 June 1843 4 September 1907 ) was a Norwegian composer and pianist . He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers , and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide . His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum , as well as helping develop a national identity , much as Jean Sibelius and Antonn Dvok did in Finland and Bohemia respectively . # Biography # Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen , Norway , on 15 June 1843 . His parents were Alexander Grieg ( 18061875 ) , a merchant and vice-consul in Bergen ; and Gesine Judithe Hagerup ( 18141875 ) , a music teacher and daughter of Edvard Hagerup . The family name , originally spelled Greig , has Scottish origins . After the Battle of Culloden in 1746 , Grieg 's great-grandfather , Alexander Greig , traveled widely , settling in Norway about 1770 , and establishing business interests in Bergen .

Grieg studied in several schools , including Tanks Upper School , Tanks School and the N.P.S , Norwegian Private School . In the summer of 1858 , Grieg met the eminent Norwegian violinist Ole Bull , who was a family friend ; Bull 's brother was married to Grieg 's aunt . Bull recognized the 15-year-old boy 's talent and persuaded his parents to send him to the Leipzig Conservatory , the piano department of which was directed by Ignaz Moscheles . Grieg enrolled in the conservatory , concentrating on the piano , and enjoyed the many concerts and recitals given in Leipzig . He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study . An exception was the organ , which was mandatory for piano students . In the spring of 1860 , he survived a life-threatening lung disease , pleurisy and tuberculosis . Throughout his life , Grieg 's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine . He suffered from numerous respiratory infections , and ultimately developed combined lung and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanatoria both in Norway and abroad . Several of his doctors became his personal friends . In 1861 , Grieg made his debut as a concert pianist in Karlshamn , Sweden . In 1862 , he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town , where his programme included Beethoven 's ' ' Pathtique ' ' sonata . In 1863 , Grieg went to Copenhagen , Denmark , and stayed there for three years . He met the Danish composers J. P. E. Hartmann and Niels Gade . He also met his fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak ( composer of the Norwegian national anthem ) , who became a good friend and source of inspiration . Nordraak died in 1866 , and Grieg composed a funeral march in his honor . On 11 June 1867 , Grieg married his first cousin , Nina Hagerup . The next year , their only child , Alexandra , was born . Alexandra died in 1869 from meningitis . In the summer of 1868 , Grieg wrote his Piano Concerto in A minor while on holiday in Denmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 April 1869 in the Casino Theater in Copenhagen . Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in Christiania ( as Oslo was then named ) . In 1868 , Franz Liszt , who had not yet met Grieg , wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education , which led to Grieg 's obtaining a travel grant . The two men met in Rome in 1870 . On Grieg 's first visit , they went over Grieg 's Violin Sonata No. 1 , which pleased Liszt greatly . On his second visit , in April , Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto , which Liszt proceeded to sightread ( including the orchestral arrangement ) . Liszt 's rendition greatly impressed his audience , although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly . Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on orchestration , ( for example , to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet ) .

Grieg was struck by the sadness in Tchaikovsky. cite web Grieg was awarded two honorary doctorates , first by Cambridge University in 1894 and the next from Oxford University in 1906. # Later years # The Norwegian government provided him with a pension . In the spring 1903 , Grieg made nine 78-rpm gramophone recordings of his piano music in Paris ; all of these historic discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs , despite limited fidelity . Grieg also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and Welte-Mignon reproducing system , all of which survive today and can be heard .

His final words were Well , if it must be so . The funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people out on the streets of his home town to honor him . Following his wish , his own ' ' Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak ' ' was played in an orchestration by his friend Johan Halvorsen , who had married Grieg 's niece .

Edvard Grieg and his wife considered themselves Unitarians and Nina went to the Unitarian church in Copenhagen after his death . # Music # Some of Grieg 's early works include a symphony ( which he later suppressed ) and a piano sonata . He also wrote three violin sonatas and a cello sonata . Grieg also composed the incidental music for Henrik Ibsen 's play , Peer Gynt - which includes the famous excerpt entitled , In the Hall of the Mountain King . In this piece of music , the adventures of the anti-hero , Peer Gynt , are related , including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding . The angry guests chase him , and Peer falls , hitting his head on a rock . He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls . The music of In the Hall of the Mountain King represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats . The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain . In an 1874 letter to his friend Frants Beyer , Grieg expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the movement he composed for Peer Gynt , writing I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King something that I literally ca n't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies , exaggerated Norwegian nationalism , and trollish self-satisfaction ! But I have a hunch that the irony will be discernible . Grieg 's ' ' Holberg Suite ' ' was originally written for the piano , and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra . Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Henrik Ibsen , Hans Christian Andersen , Rudyard Kipling and others . Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet . Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer 's complete piano music during 1978 and 1980 . The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by BIS Records .
